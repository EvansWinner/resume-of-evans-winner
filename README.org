* Resume of Evans Winner

Thank you for taking an interest in my [[https://github.com/EvansWinner/resume-of-evans-winner/blob/master/resume.org][resume]].

If you would like a copy of the resume in a different format, you can
use the code included in this GitHub site and run the Makefile.  You
will need Emacs 24 with org-mode version 8 or above, and you will need
pandoc.  You will also need to edit build.el to contain the location
of org-mode on your system and of the org-mode etc/ directory.
