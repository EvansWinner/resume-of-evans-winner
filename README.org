* Resume of Evans Winner

Thank you for taking an interest in my resume.  It can be found in any
of several formats at its home here on GitHub.  For online reading, I
recommend resume.html; for printing, the .pdf version, resume.pdf.

If you would like to build the resume from source (why would you?) you
will need Emacs 24 with org-mode version 8 or above, and you will need
pandoc.  You will also need to edit build.el to contain the location
of org-mode on your system and of the org-mode etc/ directory.
